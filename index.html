      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> After being an Intervention Specialist in the education field for 15 years, I decided it was time to make a career change. As an educator, I was always intrigued by the educational apps and websites that we used to supplement my teaching. I figured that I should use this curiosity to pursue a new career that would involve working on apps and websites!
